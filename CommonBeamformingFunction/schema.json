  "description": "This Class represents common beamforming functionality (eg: SSB beams) for the NRSectorCarrier.The CommonBeamformingFunction provides capability to configure the advanced antenna for a sector carrier. The configuration capability is provided by selection of coverageShape, digitalTilt and digitalAzimuth. These attributes represent the wanted coverage area and radiation pattern on a sector carrier related to an antenna transmission point.",
